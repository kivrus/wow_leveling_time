A lightweight web tool to estimate how long it will take your character to level from your current level to 60 in World of Warcraft Classic (Vanilla), factoring in your play speed and rested XP bonus.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

* Lightweight Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS front-end, no build tools required
* Estimates total leveling time based on your current average XP/hour
* Applies your Rested XP bonus for faster gains when offline
* Adjusts pacing to reflect community benchmark rates across early, mid, and late levels
* Interactive chart mapping expected daily level progression

## 🔧 How It Works

The calculator first determines your average XP per hour from the XP you’ve already earned and the time you’ve spent playing.
It applies a rested XP bonus—reflecting faster gains on kills when your character has been offline for a while—up to a predefined cap.
Next, it adjusts each level’s pacing based on community benchmark rates to account for varying difficulty across levels.
Finally, it adds up the time needed for all remaining levels and converts the total into days based on your daily playtime setting.
